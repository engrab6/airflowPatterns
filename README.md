GPU Accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Simulation of Indoor Air flow: Effects of Sub grid-scale Model in
LES

–The objective of the research work was the simulation of turbulent flow phenomena inside indoor envi-
ronment in a efficient approach by using high performance computing with graphics processor units.
– During the project a 3D Lattice Boltzmann Method(LBM) based large eddy simulation(LES) turbulence
model was developed using CUDA programming and the three different sub-grid scale models were
studied to determine the most stable turbulent model for detecting chaotic flow phenomena inside the
geometry.
– Optimization of the computational algorithms for the GPU architecture was being studied and two dif-
ferent GPU based computational model was compared to identify the performance optimization in GPU
hardware.
–
e findings of the research was the preliminary works towards finding the suitable model for Indoor
airflow simulation and thus the research could be beneficiary for building efficient natural ventilation
strategies in Indoor air quality research.
